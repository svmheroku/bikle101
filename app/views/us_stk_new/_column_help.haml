  One thing which will not work is pop-up-help messages.

  %h4 Stock Ticker
  This site displays short-term predictions on about 200 different stocks.
  %br/
  %br/
  I identify a stock by its ticker also known as the stock symbol.
  %br/
  %br/
  I usually do not identify a stock by the name of its company.

  %h4 GMT / UTC Time at Hour 0
  This column contains GMT/UTC timestamps for each prediction-score.
  %br/
  %br/
  During winter, GMT is 5 hours ahead of EST, 8 hours ahead of PST, and 8 hours behind JST.
  %br/
  %br/
  During summer, GMT is 4 hours ahead of EDT, 7 hours ahead of PDT, 1 hour behind BST, and 8 hours behind JST.
  %br/
  %br/
  The current GMT/UTC time can be seen here:

  %h4 Price at Hour 0
  Every five minutes, for each of the tickers, I feed the DanBot two pieces of information.
  %br/
  %br/
  I tell it the ticker's price and I tell DanBot what time it is (GMT time).
  I refer to the price as the "Price at Hour 0".
  %br/
  %br/
  If the DanBot calculates a prediction-score that I like (below -0.55 or above +0.55) I wait for 1 hour.
  %br/
  %br/
  Then I decide to either ignore the prediction
  (usually because of a large price-move move in the last hour),
  or I follow the prediction and open a short or long position corresponding to that ticker.
  %br/
  %br/
  Usually when I want to open a short position for a ticker, I instead buy a "near-the-money" put option from the options market.
  %br/
  %br/
  %a(target="g" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=near+the+money+put+option")
    http://www.google.com/search?q=near+the+money+put+option
  %br/
  %br/
  Usually a put option exhibits the same price behavior as a short position.
  %br/
  %br/
  One problem with put options is they are often not very liquid which is evident within the spread between the bid price and the ask price.
  %br/
  %br/
  A simple rule I follow in the options market is avoid buying any option which has a spread which is more than 3% the price of the option.
  %br/
  %br/
  An example of a ticker which has nice liquid put options is SPY:
  %br/
  %a(href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/op?s=SPY+Options" target="y")http://finance.yahoo.com/q/op?s=SPY+Options
  %br/
  %br/
  An example of a ticker which often has unattractive put options is VMW:
