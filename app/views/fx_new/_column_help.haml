#help4_currencypair(title="Currency-pair")
  Currency-pairs have names like EUR/USD.
  %br/
  %br/
  The name on the left is the currency getting bought.
  The name on the right is the currency I use to pay for the currency on the left.
  %br/
  %br/
  So, if I buy the EUR/USD pair, I am buying EUR with USD.
  %br/
  %br/
  If I sell the EUR/USD pair, I am selling EUR and receiving USD.
  By convention, some pairs are rarely referred to.
  For example, the EUR/USD pair is often mentioned in the media, but the USD/EUR pair is not.

#help4_gmttimeathour0(title="GMT / UTC Time at Hour 0")
  This column contains GMT/UTC timestamps for each prediction-score.
  %br/
  %br/
  During winter, GMT is 5 hours ahead of EST, 8 hours ahead of PST, and 8 hours behind JST.
  %br/
  %br/
  During summer, GMT is 4 hours ahead of EDT, 7 hours ahead of PDT, 1 hour behind BST, and 8 hours behind JST.
  %br/
  %br/
  The current GMT/UTC time can be seen here:

  During the winter, the current time in London is identical to GMT/UTC time:

#help4_danbotscoreathour0(title="DanBot Score")
  =render :partial => "fx_column_help_danbot"

#help4_priceathour0(title="Price at Hour 0")
  Every five minutes, for each of the 11 currency-pairs, I feed the DanBot two pieces of information.
  %br/
  %br/
  I tell it the price of the pair and I tell DanBot what time it is (GMT time).
  I refer to the price as the "Price at Hour 0".
  %br/
  %br/
  If the DanBot calculates a prediction-score that I like (below -0.55 or above +0.55) I wait for 1 hour.
  %br/
  %br/
  Then I decide to either ignore the prediction
  (usually because the of a large price-move move in the last hour),
  or I follow the prediction and open a position in the currency-pair.
  %br/
  %br/
  Then I close the position 5 hours later (using a clock controlled order in my brokerage account).
  %br/
  %br/
  I consider a price-move large (during a 1 hour period)
  if its normalized gain is below -0.0010 or above +0.0010 (which is a move of about 0.1%).
  %br/
  %br/

#help4_priceafter1hour(title="Price After 1 Hour")
  If the DanBot calculates a prediction-score that I like (below -0.55 or above +0.55) I wait for 1 hour.
  %br/
  %br/
  The price for the pair at that time is displayed here.
  %br/
  %br/
  If the values here are blank either we are not at Hour 1 yet
  or my price-data-feed has crashed
  or the WebBot which transfers data from the DanServers to this website has crashed.
  %br/

#help4_normalized1hrgain(title="Normalized 1 Hour Gain")
  After the DanBot issues a prediction-score for a pair, I wait 1 hour.
  %br/
  %br/
  I call this point in time, "Hour 1".
  %br/
  %br/
  Then, I look at the change in the price of the pair during that 1 hour.
  %br/
  %br/
  Next, I divide that price-change by the price at Hour 0.
  %br/
  %br/
  I call this ratio the "Normalized 1 Hour Gain".
  %br/
  %br/
  If this ratio is greater than -0.0010,
  and if the DanBot-score is less than -0.55,
  then I will open a short-position in the corresponding pair for 5 hours and then close it.
  %br/
  %br/
  I refer to that moment in time as "Hour 6" because it is exactly 6 hours after the DanBot had calculated the score for that position.
  %br/
  %br/
  If this ratio is less than +0.0010,
  and if the DanBot-score is greater than +0.55,
  then I will open a long-position in the corresponding pair for 5 hours and then close it at Hour 6.
  %br/
  %br/
  Typically I rely on clock controlled orders in my brokerage account to close a position at Hour 6.
  %br/
  %br/
  When I open a position in a currency pair, I usually do that manually at the keyboard.
  %br/
  %br/
  Usually I act by calculating the Normalized 1 Hour Gain ratio in my head 
  at exactly Hour 1 using the price displayed by my brokerage UI.
  I dont rely on this website to calculate and then display the ratio for me.
  %br/
  %br/
  Another way I often operate is to completely ignore the Normalized 1 Hour Gain ratio.
  I act based solely on the value of the DanBot-score.
  %br/
  %br/
  In that situation I just look for a DanBot-score issued within the past hour.
  Then I look at the price of the corresponding pair in my brokerage UI.
  %br/
  %br/
  If the price has not changed much or if it is favorable compared to the price at Hour 0,
  I then open a position in the pair until exactly Hour 6 and then close it using a clock controlled order.
  %br/
  %br/
  This second way of reacting to DanBot-score is less disciplined than the first
  but I have validated that it is an effective way to trade using back-testing.
  %br/
  %br/

#help4_priceafter6hours(title="Price At Hour 6")
  This is the price of the currency-pair 6 hours after the DanBot-score was calculated.
  %br/
  %br/
  If the values here are blank either we are not at Hour 6 yet
  or my price-data-feed has crashed
  or the WebBot which transfers data from the DanServers to this website has crashed.
  %br/
  %br/

#help4_5hourgainbetweenhr1andhr6(title="5 Hour Gain Between Hour 1 and Hour 6")
  Typically I open a position at Hour 1 and close it at Hour 6 which is a 5 hour duration.
  %br/
  %br/
  The change in price of the currency-pair over that 5 hour duration is displayed here.
  %br/
  %br/

#help4_normalized5hrgain(title="Normalized 5 Hour Gain Between Hour 1 and Hour 6")
  Typically I open a position at Hour 1 and close it at Hour 6 which is a 5 hour duration.
  %br/
  %br/
  Over that 5 hour duration, 
  the change in price of the currency-pair divided by the price at Hour 0 is displayed here.
  %br/
  %br/
  Suppose I open a short-position in AUD/JPY (due to a DanBot score of -0.74 I noticed).
  %br/
  %br/
  I open the position at Hour 1 at a price of 86.3473.
  %br/
  %br/
  I wait 5 hours and close the position at Hour 6 at a price of 85.9327.
  %br/
  %br/
  The 5 hour gain would then be: -0.4146
  %br/
  %br/
  The normalized 5 hour gain would be about - 0.41 / 86 which is about -0.0048.
  %br/
  %br/
  This gain would be less lucrative than a short-position in EUR/USD which had a price move of 
  1.4313 to 1.4225.
  %br/
  %br/
  The normalized 5 hour gain for the EUR/USD position is about:
  %br/
  %br/
  (1.4225 - 1.4313) / 1.43 which is about -0.0060.
  %br/
  %br/
  So, the normalized gain of the short-position in AUD/JPY is about -0.0048.
  %br/
  %br/
  And the normalized gain of the short-position in EUR/USD is about -0.0060.
  %br/
  %br/
  Clearly the short-position in EUR/USD is more lucrative than the short-position in AUD/JPY.
  %br/
  %br/
  If I have a normalized gain of 0.0060, how much money is that?
  %br/
  %br/
  The calculation is simple, just multiply 0.0060 times the size of the position.
  %br/
  %br/
  The smallest position I can trade is about $20,000.
  %br/
  %br/
  So, 0.0060 x $20,000 is $120.
  %br/
  %br/
  When I make Forex trades I usually finance them using borrowed money from my broker called "Margin".
  %br/
  %br/
  My broker will extend me a loan up to 97.5% of the position to open the position.
  I need to supply my own money to make-up the remaining 2.5% of the position.
  %br/
  %br/
  So, to earn that $120, I need to supply $500 of my own cash.
  %br/
  %br/
  If I earn $120 from an investment of $500 that is a rate of return of 100 x 120 / 500 is 24%.
  %br/
  %br/
  I do, however, need to pay 2 brokerage commissions to open and then close the postion which is about $5.
  So, that knocks the rate of return down to 100 x 115 / 500 is 23%
  %br/
  %br/
  A little algebra reveals that the rate of return is about 4000 x normalized 5 hour gain.
  %br/
  %br/
  After doing many Forex trades, I've just memorized the fact that a normalized 5 hour gain of 0.0010
  is about the same as a 4% gain on my 2.5% margin, which is a decent gain for an asset held only 5 hours.
