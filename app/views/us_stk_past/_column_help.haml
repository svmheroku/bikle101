#help4_stockticker
  %h4 Stock Ticker
  This site displays short-term predictions on about 200 different stock tickers.
  %br/
  %br/
  I have found that some stocks are more predictable than others.
  Obviously if I decide that a stock is consistently unpredictable, I will replace its ticker with another ticker.
  %br/
  %br/
  Another attribute of stocks which interests me is liquidity.
  I consider a stock liquid if the spread between bid and ask is less than 5 cents.
  %br/
  %br/
  For options on the stock, I am very pleased if the spread between bid and ask is less than 5 cents.
  I want to focus my efforts on stocks which are both highly predictable and very liquid.

#help4_avgtickerpriceathour0
  %h4 Avg Ticker Price at Hour 0
  Each week,
  when I collect several DanBot scores, I also collect corresponding ticker prices.
  %br/
  %br/
  An average of that list of prices is displayed here.
  %br/
  %br/
  I have noticed that the ticker price averages tend to be a little higher when corresponding average DanBot scores are negative (bearish).
  %br/
  %br/
  If the DanBot is powerful enough to predict when a stock is overpriced, it seems plausible that higher average prices would correspond to bearish predictions.
  %br/
  %br/
  Most, but not all, stock prices revert-to-mean after they make a significant short-term move in one direction.
  %br/
  %br/
  I know that the DanBot has the capability to make accurate predictions based on this type of stock behavior.
  %br/
  %br/
  Also the DanBot can sense if if a stock does not usually revert-to-mean but instead "trends".
  %br/
  %br/
  When the DanBot is sensing a stock which trends, I would expect the bullish DanBot scores to correspond to higher average ticker prices.

  %h4 Avg DanBot Score at Hour 0
  When I collect several DanBot scores for a ticker over the span of a week,
  I average them and display that average here.

#help4_sharperatio
  %h4 Sharpe Ratio
  I use the Sharpe Ratio to help me measure the past effectiveness of the DanBot.
  %br/
  %br/
  First I compare the sign of the Sharpe Ratio to the sign of Avg DanBot Score.
  %br/
  %br/
  If the signs match, that indicates to me that DanBot was probably effective.
  If the signs don't match that is definitely bad; the DanBot was issuing "false positive" predictions.
  %br/
  %br/
  For example if I see that Avg DanBot Score for ADBE is -0.65,
  I want to see a Sharpe Ratio of -1.0 or less.  If it were less than -10.0, I would be very pleased.
  %br/
  %br/
  If the Sharpe Ratio is between -0.4 and 0.0, 
  that is not great but I was not losing money either.
  %br/
  %br/
  I calculate the Sharpe Ratio by taking the Avg of 24hr Gains and dividing it by Standard Deviation of 24hr Gains.
  %br/
  %br/
  If the Standard Deviation of 24hr Gains is zero, I replace it with 0.001 to avoid divide-by-zero errors.
  %br/
  %br/
  Wikipedia has an article about the Sharpe Ratio:
  %a(target="w" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio")http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio
  %br/
  %br/
  For some, the article is a bit dense but the idea is simple.
  %br/
  %br/
  Simply put,
  If I am earning small gains from a stock which has large price fluctuations, that is a bad situation.
  As the situation grows worse, the Sharpe Ratio moves toward zero.
  %br/
  %br/
  Since the Sharpe Ratio can be viewed as a fraction, I see two ways it can move towards zero.
  The numerator of the fraction is the average gain and if that number is zero, then the Sharpe Ratio is zero.
  %br/
  %br/
  The denominator of the fraction is the standard deviation of the gains.
  If the gains wildly fluctuate, the standard deviation grows large and the Sharpe Ratio moves toward zero.
  %br/
  %br/
  I describe a simple example below using IBM.
  %br/
  %br/
  Suppose during week one I do only 2 IBM trades and earn gains of $10 and $30.
  The average gain for that week is $20 and the standard deviation for those 2 trades is about 14.1
  %br/
  %br/
  During week two I do another 2 IBM trades and earn gains of -$20 and $60 and again the average for that week is $20.
  %br/
  %br/
  Obviously -$20 and +$60 are spread farther apart then $10 and $30 so when I calculate the standard deviation for the second 2 trades, I expect to see a larger number.  And I do; it is about 56.6
  %br/
  %br/
  Although the average gains match, I would argue that the "quality" of the gains from week one are better because
  I endured less heartburn than during week two.
  %br/
  %br/
  This heartburn cost is quantified by the Sharpe Ratio.
  The Sharpe Ratio for week two is closer to zero than the Sharpe Ratio for week one.
  %br/
  %br/
  To calculate the Sharpe Ratio I divide the average by the standard deviation.
  For week one the Sharpe Ratio is 20 / 14.1 and for week two the Sharpe Ratio is 20 / 56.6
